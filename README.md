# Abule-Egba-Community-Medical-Outreach-Data-Analysis
# OVERVIEW
This project analyses real-world data collected during a school project for a community medical outreach program in Abule Egba, Lagos, aimed at providing free health checks and medications to residents. The dataset captures patient demographics, vital signs and test results for conditions such as malaria, hypertension, diabetes, and hepatitis. 
# DATA SOURCE
The data was originally put together by students in my school, and I was in charge of data collection, organisation and cleaning and visualization.
