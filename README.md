# ABULE-EGBA-COMMUNITY-MEDICAL-OUTREACH-DATA-ANALYSIS
# OVERVIEW
This project analyses real-world data collected during a school project for a community medical outreach program in Abule Egba, Lagos, aimed at providing free health checks and medications to residents. The outreach focused on malaria relief, health education, child health and general body checkups. The dataset captures patient demographics, vital signs and test results for conditions such as malaria, hypertension, diabetes, and hepatitis. Key insights include the distribution of blood pressure categories, age and gender trends. 

# TOOLS USED
- MICROSOFT EXCEL (Dataset was small, so Excel was the best for analysis): Data cleaning, analysis and visualisation.
- PIVOT TABLES & CHARTS.
- IFS, COUNTIFS, TEXTJOIN FUNCTIONS FOR CLASSIFICATION AND SUMMARIES.

# OUTCOMES
- Visual dashboard summarising test results and medications.
- KPIs for medication distribution, service coverage, and prevalence.
- Actionable health insights for post-outreach evaluation.

# DATA SOURCE
The data was collected by students in my school, and I was responsible for data collation, organisation, cleaning, and visualisation.
